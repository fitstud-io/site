The notion that a robust workout can positively impact your mental well-being is not a recent discovery. Even Siddhartha Gautama, more commonly recognized as the Buddha, encouraged his followers to “keep the body in good health… Otherwise, we shall not be able to trim the lamp of wisdom and keep our mind strong and clear.”

While many of us have long sensed the importance of physical activity in preserving our mental health, quantifying its psychological effects has posed a challenge. Exercise has been utilized in the treatment of clinical anxiety, and a Harvard study indicated that increased physical activity can reduce our chances of experiencing depression by more than a quarter. Yet, how does a CrossFit workout, for instance, compare to conventional medical interventions?

A recent analysis of 1,039 trials conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia has finally assigned a specific value to the mental health benefits of exercise. According to the study’s principal author, engaging in regular gym workouts can be 1.5 times more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy or even medication. Furthermore, the study found that high-intensity, shorter-duration activities were the most effective in alleviating symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. This suggests that completing a challenging 15-minute dumbbell circuit may be more beneficial than practicing yoga or going for a leisurely jog. It’s important to note that therapy and prescription medications will continue to be crucial for many individuals, but it is reassuring to learn that physical gains can concurrently bolster mental resilience.
