### Ingredients:

**For the Chicken:**
- 1.5 lbs (about 680 g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon

**For the Quinoa:**
- 1 cup quinoa (uncooked)
- 2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt to taste

**For the Vegetables:**
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the Dressing:**
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

**1. Marinate and Cook the Chicken:**

 In a bowl, mix olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Add the chicken breasts and coat them well. Let them marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours).

 Preheat your grill or oven (375°F / 190°C). Grill or bake the marinated chicken for about 20-25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Let it rest, then slice it.

**2. Cook the Quinoa:**

 Rinse the quinoa under cold water. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa, broth, olive oil, and salt. Bring it to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and set aside.

**3. Roast the Vegetables:**

Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). On a baking sheet, toss the diced bell pepper, zucchini, and broccoli with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them out in a single layer.

Roast the vegetables in the oven for about 20 minutes or until tender and slightly charred, stirring halfway through.

**4. Prepare the Dressing:**

In a small bowl, mix the Greek yogurt, honey, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper until well combined.

**5. Assemble the Bowls:**

In meal prep containers, layer the quinoa, followed by sliced chicken, roasted vegetables, and a dollop of dressing. Optionally, you can add fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro for extra flavor.

**6. Store:**

Seal the containers and store them in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.

### Tips:

- Feel free to customize the vegetables based on your preference or what you have on hand.
- You can add extras like avocado, nuts, or seeds for added texture and nutrition.
