### So, about that "name"

I want to clarify that I'm not an egomaniac, and it's understandable that you might be skeptical. In fact, those who truly know me personally would vouch for the opposite. So, it's important to note that the title of 'Trek Stud' wasn't something I bestowed upon myself. I'm actually a landscape photographer, and that's why I chose the name Trek Studio for my company. The name 'Trek Studio' combines 'trek' and 'studio,' reflecting my love for outdoor photography. When I registered the domain trekstud.io, I thought I was being clever. However, many people only read up to the period, resulting in some amusing misunderstandings.

In a playful manner, my friends decided to tease me by calling me 'Trek Stud' to embarrass me. Taking it lightheartedly, I embraced the nickname and even adopted it as my trail name. It's my world, and I believe everyone has the freedom to do what they want. Don't judge me üòÅ.

## How it happened

I have been involved in website and graphic design for quite some time now, both professionally and as a hobby, since the AOL days and probably before, do you know what a BBS is? Yeah I probably just age checked my self ü§∑. 

Photography, on the other hand, was more of a serendipitous discovery for me. However, it quickly became an addiction, and now I find myself seeing photo opportunities everywhere I look. Consequently, it was only a matter of time before I decided to establish a photography business and create my own brand. Over time, all my hobbies gradually transformed into income streams, and I must say, it's truly living the dream.

Honestly, I find contentment in simple things and possess a humble nature. My primary goal is to pursue my passions while also ensuring the well-being of my family.
